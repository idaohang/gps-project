We evaluate the performance of several filtering algorithms for pose estimation of a mobile GPS receiver.  Often, model parameters such as process and measurement noise covariances are not known a priori, so engineers must hand-tune these per application and then evaluate them to ensure quality and stability.  We found that a simple time-varying Kalman filter with an empirically derived measurement noise covariance and a static, hand-tuned process noise covariance performs quite well for our mobile datasets, is simple to implement, and is easy to tune.  We perform both qualitative pose evaluations using maps as well as quantitative stability and statistical hypothesis tests to validate the model of our system.
