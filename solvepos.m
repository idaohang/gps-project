% this function calculates the position of the observation station
%
% input: 'ephem' 4-by-24 matrix, each of whose rows contains 
%                orbital ephemerides and other navigation message
%                data for a given satellite.

%					< see formatdata.m for description >
%
%		'pseudoR' 4-by-1 vector which contains pseudo-ranges (meters) for
%		          the satellites being used in the navigational solution
%						[ pr; pr; pr; pr]
%
%                 these must be pseudoranges from the same 4 satellites
%                 whose ephemerides and clock correction data are
%                 contained in the corresponding rows of ephem.
%
%		'guess'   3-by-1 vector containing an initial position guess in
%		          ECEF coordinates (meters).
%
%		'gpsTime' variable which contains the GPS time according to the
%                 receiver clock (seconds) for which a navigational  
%		          solution will be found.  This is the receiver
%                 clock time at which the 4 pseudoranges in pseudoR
%                 have been measured.
%
% output: 'posOBS'  1-by-5 row vector which contains the GPS receiver
%                   clock time (seconds), ECEF coordiates of the 
%                   navigation solution (meters), and the receiver clock  
%                   offset at that GPS time (seconds)

%                   to receiver clock time gpsTime is gpsTime_true = 
%                   gpsTime - recCO.
