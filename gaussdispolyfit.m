% This function fits a polynomial to GPS pseudorange error data, 
% prerrhist, subtracts that polynomial from the data to create
% residual errors that have low-frequency trends removed,
% prresidhist, computes the standard deviaton of the resulting 
% residuals, sigmapr, creates a histogram of the residuals by  
% counting the data in bins 0.5*sigmapr wide, from -3.0*sigmapr to 
% 3.0*sigmapr around mean(prresidhist) -- this mean should be zero,
% computing the expected numbers in the bins based on the Gaussian
% assumption, plotting this raw histogram and expected number
% of counts data, and computing the Pearson chi-squared chi-squared
% test statistic.
%
%   inputs:   'prerrhist'     the N-by-1 vector pseudorange error 
%                             data from which to create   
%                             the histogram after subtracting out a 
%                             polynomial.
%             'npolyfit'      The order of the polynomial that will be
%                             fit to the prerrhist data, fit as a  
%                             function of the row index of prerrhist.  
%                             Note, if npolyfit = 0, then a simple  
%                             computation of the mean and
%                             subtraction of it occurs to create
%                             the residuals that are binned into
%                             a histogram.
%
%   outputs:  'sigmapr'       standard deviation of the residual pseudo
%                             ranges after subtracking of the polynomial
%                             (meters).
%             'polyprerr'     the 1-by-(npolyfit+1) vector of polynomial
%                             fit coefficients (meters) such that the 
%                             polynomial model of prerrhist is 
%                             prerrhistpoly = polyval(polyprerr,dnvec)
%                             where dnvec = (1:N)' - 0.5*(N+1)
%             'Ovec'          the 12-by-1 histogram vector that contains
%                             the counts of the histogram in the
%                             bins whose lower and upper bounds,
%                             expressed as standard deviations from
%                             the mean, are given in binlohihisto.
%                             Note: in order to lie in bin k, i.e.,
%                             in order to be counted in the number
%                             Ovec(k,1), it must be greather than
%                             or equal to the lower bin boundary
%                             in binlohihisto(k,1) and it must be
%                             less than the upper bin boundary
%                             in binlohihisto(k,1).
%             'Evec'          the 12-by-1 vector that is like Ovec,
%                             except that it is the expected number
%                             of counts given the Gaussian assumption
%                             for the residuals in prresidhist with
%                             zero mean and a standard deviaton of
%                             sigmapr.
%             'M'             = 12, the number of histogram bins.
%             'bin_pos'       the 12-by-1 vector of mid-points of
%                             prresidhist bins = (-2.75 + (0:11)'*0.5)*...

%             'N'             the total number of data points.
%             'chi2Pearson'   The Pearson chi-squared test statistic
%                             for the goodness of the Gaussian model
%                             (non-dimensional)

%                             statistic.
%             'chi2Pearson95' = chi2inv(.95,ndegreechi2), the 95%
%                             threshold that chi2Pearson should
%                             be below in 95% of the cases where the
