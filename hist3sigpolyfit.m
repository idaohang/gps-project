% This function fits a polynomial to random data, subtracts
% that polynomial from the data, computes the standard deviaton
% of the resulting residuals, and creates a histogram of the
% residuals by counting the data in bins
% 0.5*std(xresid) wide, from -3.0*std(xresid) to 3.0*std(xresid)
% around mean(xresid).
%
%   inputs:   'x'             the N-by-1 vector data from which to create   
%                             the histogram after subtracting out a 
%                             polynomial.
%             'npolyfit'      The order of the polynomial that will be
%                             fit to the x data, fit as a function of
%                             the row index of x.  Note, if npolyfit = 0,
%                             then a simple computation of the mean
%                             and subtraction of it occurs to create
%                             the residuals that are binned into
%                             a histogram.
%
%   outputs:  'mxresid'       mean of xresid = x - polyval(polyx,dnvec) 
%                             where dnvec = (1:N)' - 0.5*(N+1).
%                             This should be zero.
%			  'sxresid'       standard deviation of xresid.
%             'polyx'         the 1-by-(npolyfit+1) vector of polynomial
%                             fit coefficients such that the polynomial
%                             model of x is xpoly = polyval(polyx,dnvec)
%                             where dnvec = (1:N)' - 0.5*(N+1)
%             'histo'         the 12-by-1 histogram vector that contains
%                             the counts of the histogram in the
%                             bins whose lower and upper bounds,
%                             expressed as standard deviations from
%                             the mean, are given in binlohihisto.
%                             Note: in order to lie in  bin k, i.e.,
%                             in order to be counted in the number
%                             histo(k,1), it must be greather than
%                             or equal to the lower bin boundary
%                             in binlohihisto(k,1) and it must be
%                             less than the upper bin boundary
%                             in binlohihisto(k,1).
